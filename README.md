# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio
Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.

# Work Progress
* I first went over to Bootstrap to get the proper links needed to have Bootswatch to work.
* At Bootswatch.com I selected the LUX theme to use for my layout.
* I started working on my idex html first as it would be my home screen.
* First part I worked on was the nav bar and selected the Nav code that would work best for me.
* I then proceeded to link up the other sites on the nav bar and give them the proper titles.
* I then worked on the card layout as it would then proceed to be the body of the site.  I had some trouble with the alignment but was able to figure it out.
* Then I insterted my picture and used float left to have the text wrap around it from my bio.
* Turning my attention to my contact site, I went on to Bootswatch to link an input box to be able to put in information.
* The portfolio page is where I had to break up into rows and columns.
* I added the images and added alt tages to them.
* I proceeded to put new descriptions under the images, that will esesntially be description of projects in the future.
* I then added a footer that contained links to both my Facebook and LinkedIn, and centered their logos.
